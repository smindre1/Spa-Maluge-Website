                <p className="mainFont colorBckgrdG">Where does the word spa come from? Although there is no clear answer to the question of where the word spa came to be associated with healing practices, there are two main theories about the etymology of this term: "SPA" is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase "Salus per Aquam", meaning "health from water", and "SPA" is named after the Belgian village of SPA, where hot mineral springs were used by Roman soldiers to treat muscle pain and battle wounds.</p>

                <p className="mainFont colorBckgrdG">Although many people associate traditional spas with Roman baths, there is evidence that spa therapy existed thousands of years ago when people believed in the healing powers of mineral waters.

                One of the first written evidence of the use of bathing as a healing process, and not just a hygienic ritual, comes from the ancient Greek philosopher Hippocrates, who lived more than 2000 years ago, between 460 and 370 BC.
                    
                He suggested that the cause of all disease was an imbalance of body fluids, and advocated that "the path to health is to take an aromatic bath and an aromatic massage every day."
                
                In 1326, Collin le Loup, a metalworker from Liege, Belgium, discovered chalybeate springs (mineral spring waters containing iron salts) in the city of Spa. Eventually a famous health center was founded around these springs, and the term "spa" came to mean any health center located near natural springs, with individual springs being associated with the diseases for which they were considered beneficial.

                But it's not only in Europe that rituals associated with visiting spa treatments are developing. From the Japanese ryokan to the Turkish hammam and Finnish saunas/steam rooms, various healing facilities are popping up around the world. By the Elizabethan era, spas were fully ingrained in British culture and have since been refined and developed, but still retain their humble origins.</p>

                <p className="mainFont colorBckgrdG">The enthusiasm for spa treatments soon spread to the United States, where the first mass spa opened in Saratoga Springs, New York.

                The first day spa was introduced by Elizabeth Arden in 1910 and is known as Manhattan's Red Door Salon. This spa offers manicures, facials and more, making it much closer to a modern experience.</p>

                <h2 className="serviceSubTitle lineBreak">Modern Spa Center</h2>
                <p className="mainFont">The growing demographic of modern spas is largely due to the reinvention that has slowly developed over the past 10 years - and not just in terms of increasing popularity among men. While most spas from the 1980s to the early 2000s were luxury establishments offering all sorts of special services to simply make the client feel great (like afternoon tea), today's leading spas focus instead on internal health. Wellness is now the ultimate goal, be it deep tissue massage targeting pressure points, balancing steam baths or more carefully tailored spa treatments aimed at achieving specific benefits such as weight loss or detoxification.</p>

                <h2 className="serviceSubTitle lineBreak">Global Spa Trend</h2>
                <p className="mainFont">As spas strive to develop new, exciting and effective treatments for their guests, the industry has begun to seek out new global influences from around the world. It's a stark contrast to the spas of the 80s and 90s, which used to look almost the same - a generic, beige, vaguely Asian space with a few massage areas. Today, globalization has allowed spa visitors to become more familiar with local spa and wellness practitioners from around the world. So we have access and knowledge about every type of massage you can imagine, from Thai to Indian, as well as the excitement of a variety of global experiences, be it a Middle Eastern hammam, a Mexican temazcal or a Russian bathhouse.</p>

                <h2 className="serviceSubTitle lineBreak">Personalized Treatments</h2>
                <p className="mainFont">As spas strive for a wider range of treatments, they are also focusing on providing more specialized treatments for various conditions. These days, spas are getting better at offering personalized medical spa treatments to guests who might not necessarily enjoy more traditional treatments. This selection of day spa packages will not only meet the individual needs of each guest, but will also contribute to a holistic impact on the community.

                This is not only a return to the roots of the spa, but also the development of future innovative offerings. Even during the Roman Empire, mineral springs were not just places for bathing, they were comprehensive recreation centers.</p>
