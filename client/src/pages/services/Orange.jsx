          <h2 className='serviceSubTitle lineBreak'>What to Expect During a Hot Orange Massage</h2>
          <p className='lineBreak mainFont'>The hot oranges are gently and smoothly rolled over the body working the muscles, relieving pain, fatigue and bad mood, leaving a wonderful aroma and pleasant warmth throughout the body. Smooth movements along the energy points are used to completely relax the body.</p>
          <p className='mainFont lineBreak'>After the body is worked on, the oranges are cut into two parts and the skin is rubbed again with the orange pulps and slices, so the nutrients are instantly absorbed into the pores of the skin! The pleasant smell of fruits fills the air, adding aromatherapy to the massage and relaxing you due to a combination of warmth and smooth deep pressure massage technique in which you will lose the sense of time and reality... The body relaxes and the brain literally switches off! The aroma of citrus has a bright anti-stress effect.</p>
          <p className='mainFont lineBreak'>This beautiful ritual removes waste and toxins from your body activating the metabolic process and improving the blood circulation which also improves the skin condition. It also eliminates cellulite, relieves stress and nervous tension. You are worthy of kindness and self-care; take a moment from the busy Life to acknowledge your value and treat yourself with the same care and respect you would offer to someone you love!</p>
